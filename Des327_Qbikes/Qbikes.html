                    <p>Chicago Cut is particularly suited to Power Meals when you take into account where it’s located, right on the river at the base of an office building home to a top-level consulting company, a prestigious law firm where people get paid more than you, and Governor Rauner’s private equity firm. These businesses make Chicago Cut a go-to spot for corporate cards, but know that it also gets a steady stream of locals and regular people looking for a steakhouse Power Meal in River North.</p>

                    <h2>Immm Rice& Beyond</h2>

                    <p>You’ve probably been to a few restaurants where you wanted to order pretty much everything on the menu. But unless you were really hungry, rich, or both, that likely wasn’t a feasible option. At Immm Rice & Beyond, it basically is - which is one reason we like this place so much.</p>

                    <p>This is a casual BYOB spot in Uptown that specializes in Thai street food, and the menu is so extensive that it takes up a huge chalkboard wall. That’s probably the first thing you’ll notice when you walk in - and the second thing you’ll notice is the steam table full of stews and curries, which smell like they’ve been developing flavor all day long (because, well, they have).</p>

                    <p>You’re going to want to try as many of those as possible, and the good news is that you can (especially if you bring a few friends with you). Just go for the “Thai Dinner Table” option, which allows you to order lots of different dishes in small, tasting-size portions for $6 each. Like the fantastic pangang mhoo (thinly sliced pork in a rich and spicy curry), the moo whan (caramelized pork belly in a fish sauce that’s the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and fatty), and the fried hard-boiled eggs that we wish we could have for lunch every day. Beyond the Thai Dinner Table options, be sure to get a few full-sized things, like the pad prik khing in a spicy lime curry, and the khao mung gai (poached chicken, broth, rice, and a ginger chili sauce) that’s one of the best things on the menu. Just skip the pad thai, the overly sweet pad see eiw, and the thin green curry with chicken - you have a whole chalkboard full of better options here.</p>
